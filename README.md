# PG->RDF Experimental Converter

PREC is a WIP set of tools to convert any Property Graph into RDF.

Its main differences with other converters are:
- It intends to convert the PG into RDF graphs that looks like usual RDF graphs,
by limiting the amount of boilterplate due to the data being from a Property
Graph
- It enables the user to map some of the labels and prorpety names used in the
PG to an existing vocabulary, by providing a *context* written in Turtle format.

PREC uses the PREC ontology that is described at https://bruy.at/prec. The PREC
ontology is mostly used to describe how to convert an RDF graph generated by
PREC with its default modelization into a more user friendly graph.

## Quick start from the repository

The repository contains a data folder with some exportation of Neo4j data by
using the APOC plugin. PREC can be quickly experimented by using these provided
example files.

- `git clone https://github.com/BruJu/PREC`
- `npm install --save-dev`

- Example 1: A Property Graph with a node about the POTUS
    - `npx ts-node prec.ts apoc2rdf data\ex1_potus.json -c data\ex1_potus.ttl`
    - `data\ex1_potus.json` contains the exportation of a Neo4J Property Graph
    about the POTUS and the USA.
    - `data\ex1_potus.ttl` is a context. *In this project, we call a*
    *Context a Turtle File that describes a mapping from the elements of Property*
    *Graph to an RDF ontology*. This context maps labels of the PG into IRIs
    mainly from DBpedia and Schema.org

- Example 2: The node Ann likes the node Dan
    - `npx ts-node prec.ts apoc2rdf data\ex2_annlikesdan1.json data\anndan.ttl`


## Using PREC as a library

It is possible to import PREC to get access to functions to produce RDF graphs
from a Gremin or a Neo4j connection. The produced output will be an
[RDF/JS DatasetCore](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/#datasetcore-interface).


## Using PREC with CLI

Run `npx prec -h` to have a full list of the current tools.

**PG -> RDF**

- If you want to provide a context, use the `--context path/to/your/context`
option.

- From the Cypher or the Gremlin API
  - `npx prec cypher2rdf` translates Property Graphs from Neo4J to RDF. This
  tool connects itself to the Neo4J instance to extract the nodes
  and relationships (named edges in the rest of PREC).
  - `npx prec gremlin2rdf` translates "Tinkerpop enabled"
  property graphs to RDF. It works by connecting to the Gremlin API and making
  requests to extract the graph.

- From a JSON file:
  - `npx prec apoc2rdf` and `npx prec cypherJson2rdf` translates Property
  Graphs to RDF. The input is the result of some operations (documented below)
  that you have to do.

- From an RDF graph:
  - `npx prec applyContext` applies a context to an RDF graph previously
  generated by another command that did not have any context applied to.


**RDF -> PG**

- `rdf-to-pg.ts` allows to come back to Property Graphs from a RDF previously
generated by PREC without applying any context.


### Converting your own Property Graph to RDF

![](docs/general_process.svg)

The easiest way to transform a Property Graph is by providing a Cypher or a
Gremlin connection, and optionally a *Context* to get a nicer output.

In the graph, an arrow means the step ends here, a hook means the process
will continue.

For example, if you provide a Gremlin connection, you will get an "Idiomatic RDF
Graph" (if you didn't provide a context, the Idiomatic RDF Graph is equals to
the structural description of the PG in RDF).

### From Neo4j
`

#### By letting PREC connect to the Neo4j database

You can also extract directly the graph from your Neo4J database.

- `npx prec cypher-to-rdf username password (uri-to-your-neo4j-instance) (-c=contextfile.ttl)`

Default username should be neo4j and password is the one you entered when
creating the database. Default uri is the local instance with the default Neo4j
parameters.


#### With the result of a Cypher query

Run a Cypher query like this one:
- `match (src)-[edge]->(dest) return src,edge,dest LIMIT 5`
- The return instruction must return nodes and edges.
    - you can't write src.myProperty
- Get the result in JSON format (in Neo4J Browser : choose Export JSON after running the query)
- Use the `cypherJson2rdf` subcommand, for example if your output file is `data\movies_cypher_all.json`
    - `npx prec cypherJson2rdf data\movies_cypher_all.json`


#### From a Json Representation of the Property Graph using APOC


You can also use the APOC plugin to extract the content of your Property Graph.

To export a Neo4J property graph from your database, you need to activate APOC file export:
- Go in your database configuration (click the ... right to the database name -> Manage)
- Plugins -> Install APOC
- Settings -> add `set apoc.export.file.enabled=true` -> Apply

To export the graph structure, use this Cypher instruction: 
`CALL apoc.export.json.all("propertygraph.json",{useTypes:true})`

- `npx prec apoc2rdf /path/to/your/propertygraph.json` will output the
*Strucural description of the PG in RDF* from the
*Json Representation of the Property Graph*.


### From TinkerPop

`npx prec gremlin2rdf (URI to connect to) [-c Context]`

Default URI is the URI of a local TinkerPop Server.



### Misc.

- [The data folder](data) contains Neo4J (small) exported property graphs.
